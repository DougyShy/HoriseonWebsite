## About

In this project we added/replaced semantic code in the HTML file as well as consolidated many CSS classes with similar properties and attributes.
In this project we fixed broken links and added alt tags to images and icons for easier access.
In this project we defined a repository and used it to display our website.
In this project we utilized Git and the ability to commit multiple times to prevent errors and redundant code.

Something about DRY

## Getting Started

This website should be ready for view.

## Installing

No installation necessary.

## Usage

This can be used as an example for how to consolidate and fix semi-disfunctional or unorganized websites. CSS helps in this as does semantic HTML.
